PINNACLE STONE (A web-browser based civilization-builder game)

About the project: In an effort to improve myself as a programmer and game designer, I've taken some core concepts and unused artwork to put together a web-based single player game. In a kind of minimalist effort, I've decided to write the game using entirely HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. Enjoy :)

Still very much in ALPHA
